# Light-Sensitive-Trigger-using-Timer-IC-555
Light sensitive trigger circuit activates a relay upon detecting the absence of light on an LDR (light dependent resistor). It is particularly well suited to control outside lighting as used for driveways and garage entrances. The heart of the project is comparator-timer IC 555.
