# Light-Sensitive-Trigger-using-Timer-IC-555
Light sensitive trigger circuit activates a relay upon detecting the absence of light on an LDR (light dependent resistor). It is particularly well suited to control outside lighting as used for driveways and garage entrances. The heart of the project is comparator-timer IC 555.

Actaully while building this project in my early college days I have no Camera to capture photos of this project for your reference, but I documented it well at that time within my Project book. But the Image developed using Fritzing will really help you to get clear idea of this project.
